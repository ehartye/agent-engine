# Native UEFN FBX: coordinates and collision

Read this when an imported building is mirrored, lettering reverses, UCX hulls
are missing or circular platforms do not match their collision. First-hand
source and saved receipts checked 2026-10-02, UEFN 42.30. No new editor operation
or playtest was run for this reference. Re-discover native APIs after upgrades.

## Choose a bounded repair

| Repair | Time | Risk | Complexity | Architectural fit | Maintenance |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Calibrate one native FBX before placement | Short probe | Wrong basis or centimetre scale | Low | Target coordinates are authoritative | Record the measured basis |
| Reuse saved architecture; import a new scoped asset when needed | One explicit conversion | Dependencies and validation | Moderate | Preserve exhibits/devices | Stable labels and source hashes |
| Add owned simple collision | One mesh preflight and traces | Incorrect space or shape | Moderate | Physics matches the visible surface | Read back before rewriting |
| Reflect every scene actor | Broad edits | Reversed glyphs and broken bindings | High | Changes unrelated content | Difficult to maintain |

The museum corrected only its architecture. It retained exhibit and device
positions. A whole-scene conversion is unnecessary for this bounded repair.

## Measure this importer's basis

**Tested:** this native FBX route mapped Blender `(x,y,z)` to `(x,-y,z)` and
metres to native centimetres. Actor scale `(1,-1,1)` restored the building's
planned layout. The earlier MCP-imported gallery used a different basis;
reflecting its actor aligned platforms but reversed lettering. A fresh native
interior mesh normalized that scenery actor without moving exhibits.

Do not copy the reflection to another importer, asset or project without a
calibration. Check distinguishable positive-axis landmarks, native bounds,
world positions and text from the intended viewing side. Verify actual mesh
dimensions before adding scale 100 to an FBX already imported in centimetres.
Keep source-to-mesh and mesh-to-world transforms separate; collision is authored
in mesh space, not blindly copied from world coordinates.

Use named rotation arguments. Positional `Rotator` arguments did not match the
assumed order in the tested script; this call avoids that ambiguity:

```python
import unreal

rotation = unreal.Rotator(pitch=0.0, yaw=90.0, roll=0.0)
```

This constructor form was used in the museum. Its resulting transform still
needs readback in the target; syntactically valid rotation is not visual proof.

## Separate glyph correction from room placement

**Tested:** the native-only FBX export reflected local X on named lettering
meshes before joining the architecture. Portable GLB lettering was retained.
Two-sided imported material-instance overrides completed the reflected extruded
glyph faces. The narrow material names were shared with cream/ink architecture,
so those surfaces also became two-sided; runtime cost was not measured.

Apply an importer-specific correction only to identified glyph geometry. Inspect
readability and winding in a native image; do not repair source ordering or
identity errors by swapping artist colors. Prefer separately scoped lettering
materials when a shared surface override would affect the room. Two-sided
rendering does not make text opaque from behind; signage backing remains a
separate requirement.

## Read actual simple collision after import

**Tested:** exported `UCX_<mesh>_<index>` box hulls were absent from both shell
and roof imports despite `one_convex_hull_per_ucx=True`. The native import used
`FbxImportUI`, static mesh mode, combined meshes and auto collision disabled.
These options describe the tested route; they do not guarantee UCX handling.

Read `mesh.body_setup.agg_geom` rather than accepting an import success message.
Inspect counts and actual shapes. The following read-only helper uses property
calls exercised in the museum; the combined helper was syntax-checked, not run.
Call it only after verifying the loaded island and exact owned mesh identity.

```python
import unreal

def describe_simple_collision(mesh):
    if not isinstance(mesh, unreal.StaticMesh):
        raise RuntimeError("Expected the preflighted static mesh")
    body = mesh.get_editor_property('body_setup')
    if body is None:
        raise RuntimeError("Missing BodySetup; inspect the imported asset")
    geometry = body.get_editor_property('agg_geom')
    counts = {key: len(geometry.get_editor_property(key)) for key in
              ('box_elems', 'convex_elems', 'sphere_elems', 'sphyl_elems')}
    boxes = []
    for box in geometry.get_editor_property('box_elems'):
        center = box.get_editor_property('center')
        boxes.append({'centerCm': [center.x, center.y, center.z],
                      'dimensionsCm': [box.get_editor_property(axis) for axis in ('x', 'y', 'z')]})
    return {'counts': counts, 'boxes': boxes}
```

For the owned rectangular shell, native `unreal.KBoxElem` shapes replaced the
missing hulls. Set `center`, full `x/y/z` dimensions and `collision_enabled` to
`QUERY_AND_PHYSICS`; assign `agg_geom.box_elems` and then BodySetup's `agg_geom`.
The museum source reflected collision-center Y and multiplied metres by 100
before actor reflection restored world coordinates. Box dimensions are full
dimensions, not half-extents. Both the component and hulls enabled query/physics.

Compare existing shape coordinates and counts before writing. Snapshot the
owned BodySetup; do not erase unrelated sphere/capsule/convex shapes or replace
collision on a shared asset without checking its users. The museum's fully owned
shell cleared unwanted convex elements, assigned the boxes, and refreshed each
component with `set_static_mesh(None)` followed by `set_static_mesh(mesh)`.
Read back again, save explicitly and run physics checks. A count alone cannot
show that boxes are in the right place or leave doorways open.

## Match circular decks instead of using square covers

**Tested:** a separate reusable cylinder imported with bounds origin Z=50 cm,
extents `(100,100,50)` cm. `StaticMeshEditorSubsystem` exposed
`set_convex_decomposition_collisions(mesh, 1, 64, 100000)`; it returned success
and one convex element was read back. This produced a tight hull for that
cylinder, not a universal decomposition recipe for arbitrary meshes.

Twenty-nine hidden, non-rendering collision actors matched the layers of thirteen
round exhibit platforms. Their component collision stayed `QUERY_AND_PHYSICS`.
Reuse the saved mesh; stable labels reject duplicates and repeated placement
created zero new actors. Inspect center, rim and a point outside the circle's
diagonal corner. A square box can appear correct at center and still block empty
floor near its corners. These decks are walking surfaces, not evidence that
moving exhibit meshes provide gunfight cover.

## Check editor physics and retain the runtime gate

**Tested:** the repaired shell had twelve boxes and roof one. Ten editor traces
checked floor/roof/wall/divider blocking and open entrance, gallery thresholds
and return passage. Thirty-nine deck checks sampled center/rim/outside-corner
heights; all passed within 3 mm of expected surfaces. Saved recovery after an
editor crash retained the enclosure and passed traces again.

The installed `SystemLibrary.line_trace_single` returned a HitResult for a hit
and `None` for no hit. Verify the actual return contract in another installation.
The museum used `ECC_VISIBILITY`, `trace_complex=False` and explicit ignored
actors to isolate the intended collision. Test both expected hits and expected
misses; unrelated props can otherwise mask a missing walking surface.

HitResult locations were protected in this installation. Instead of parsing
their repr, the deck checker bracketed height with repeated boolean queries:
fix a start point above the surface, find a lower endpoint that hits and an
upper endpoint that misses, then bisect the endpoint height twelve times.
Use monotonic single-surface intervals, reject an unbounded result and compare
the bracketed height to planned centre/rim/floor heights in consistent units.

Editor traces do not establish Fortnite character stepping, cooked collision,
weapon cover, multiplayer or performance. Keep those acceptance checks open.

## Reimport is a separate authoring operation

An access violation occurred during asynchronous validation after repeated FBX
reimport. Its cause was not isolated; do not label reimport itself the proven
cause. Routine museum placement skips existing assets and unchanged collision.
New source geometry requires an explicit import/revision step; do not silently
reuse an old asset while claiming the new geometry landed.

Preflight every input and destination before imports. Import only the intended
assets, inspect the registry/bounds/materials/collision, save them and the owned
actor packages, then validate. Keep a pending receipt for uncertain work and
inspect recovery state before another import. Do not blindly replay a crashed
or timed-out mutation or normalize unrelated scene actors.

First-hand evidence lives in the owner's wiki at
`wiki/authored/art-explorers-fn/notes/enclosed-floorplan.md`. Museum source recipes
are `export_floorplan_fbx.py`, `export_motion_interior_fbx.py`,
`author_floorplan.py`, `author_stage_collision.py`, `check_floorplan_collision.py`
and `check_stage_collision.py`; saved receipts retain `runtimeVerified=false`.
